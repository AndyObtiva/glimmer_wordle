# TODO

## Next (v1.1.0)

- Add answer to top of the shared emoji
- Add Help menu Instructions menu item
- Change alphabet layout to be abcd instead of querty (since users will not be mouse-clicking yet using keyboard)
- Adjust the dark yellow (to #c9b458), dark green (to #6aaa64), and dark gray (to rgb 120 124 126) colors to match the original Wordle game colors
- Fix an issue with backspacing all the way back to the first character after only typing one character causing rectangle highlight not to move back to first letter
- Fix issue where upon restart, the guess button is showing above the entry field instead of below it

## Future

- Navigate letters with left and right keyboard buttons (or mouse click) and re-enter a letter (without having to use backspace)
- Being able to re-open share dialog after closing at the end of a game
- Keeping history of emoji statuses (but not answers to avoid ruining the game by making it easy to guess answers through history)
- Support Windows
- Package Native Executable for Windows
- Support Linux
- Package Native Executable for Linux
- Port to LibUI

## Maybe
